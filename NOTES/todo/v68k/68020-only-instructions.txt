68020-Only Instructions
=======================

The following instructions defined only for the 68020:

CALLM
RTM

Barring the unlikely event of a Mac program that runs only on the Mac II
and nothing else, the presence or lack of support for these instructions
has no effect on emulation of Mac programs.  Although the idea of adding
them for completeness is intriguing, it would require access to a sample
program which used them and actual hardware to compare an implementation
against, without which it would be not just useless, but untestable, and
devoid even of any ascribed value.

This almost certainly will not happen without a financial incentive.
