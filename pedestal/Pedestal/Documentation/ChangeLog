pedestal (0.1.9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * PedStreamOutput:
    - Added PedStreamOutputNull for a null device stream.
    - Fixed infinite loop in PutBytes().  (PedStreamOutputBuffered overrode 
      this method so the bug wasn't exposed before.)

pedestal (0.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

pedestal (0.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stole Debian's changelog format.
  * PedViewScrollerSimple renamed PedViewScrollerStd.
  * PedView derives from PedTask:
    - PedAgent is obsolete.
    - All subclasses of PedAgent now derive from PedWindow.
      + PedAgentDoc -> PedWindowDoc
      + PedAgentAboutBox -> PedWindowAbout
  * Send an Init() message on a new PedWindow before sending Open().
  * DoCommand() overhaul:
    - PedCommandAbout, PedCommandNew, PedCommandOpen, PedCommandQuit, and 
      PedCommandClose are obsolete.  In fact, the whole mechanism may be 
      obsolete, but it hasn't been removed yet.
    - PedWindow tracks which task is 'focused'.
    - PedApplication::DispatchCommand() dispatches the command to the front 
      window (if any) or itself.
    - PedTask::DoCommand() forwards the command to the parent task.
    - PedTaskRoot::DoCommand() drops commands on the floor.
    - PedApplication::DoCommand() responds to About, New, Open, and Quit only.
    - PedWindow::DoCommand() implements Close.
  * PedObject.cc, XAutoReleasePool.cc, and XAutoReleasePoolObj.cc created (and 
    function definitions moved there from the headers) to work around issues 
    with MrC.
  * PedScrollbar.cc:
    - #include <ControlDefinitions.h> for Universal Headers 3.3.
  * Edited Imports.scf for MoreFiles 1.5.

pedestal (0.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * PedApplication: support Suspend/Resume events.
  * PedTask, PedConsole: constructor now requires a parent task.
  * PedDispenserString: GetStringFromStream now calls Flush() first so 
    CountAheadThroughChar() doesn't keep returning 0 because there's no buffer 
    loaded.

 -- Joshua Juran <jax@users.sourceforge.net>  Thu, 31 Aug 2000 02:54:00 -0400

pedestal (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Requires A-line 2000-07-09 or later.
  * PedApplication.cc:
    - No longer behave like a droplet.
  * PedAppDroplet:
    - new subclass of PedApplication that implements droplet behavior (quit 
      after first-event odoc).
  * PedDocument now derives directly from PedTask, and no longer through 
    PedAgent.  Its role as an agent is now filled by PedAgentDoc.  This mod 
    brought to you by MacHack and Jolt.
  * PedMenuFile and PedMenuEdit are gone, replaced by PedMenuStd.  PedMenu now 
    has some nifty new code to dynamically map menu item numbers to command 
    codes. Read the docs on this, once they're written.  If you're really 
    cool, write them.  :-)
  * Ped1AppProcess has been renamed to Ped1ContextApp.  In the future, it may 
    have a new base class Ped1Context, with siblings such as Ped1ContextFBA 
    (faceless background app).

pedestal (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * PedViewScroll.cc:
    - Focus() now calls ::ClipRect() with its frame.  Corrects an animation 
      bug.
  * PedViewScroller has been split into PedViewScrollerSimple and 
    PedViewScrollerTE.  PedPaneTE modified accordingly.
  * PedPaneTE.cc:
    - After calling ::TEClick(), ::TEKey(), or directly modifying the hText 
      content, check the destRect to see if it changed.  If so, notify the 
      superview that scrolling (may have) occurred.
