Genie is an interactive, command-line-shell-based console program for Mac OS.  Rationale is left as an exercise for the reader.

Please visit <http://lamp.sourceforge.net/> for more information.

Concepts
********

Shell
=====

The shell maintains environment variables (not yet).  The shell may be tied to a window (currently) or socket (not yet) for I/O.

Console
=======

A console is an agent that displays a shell in a window.  Don't ask what an agent is.

Reference
*********

Pathname conversion
===================

POSIX pathnames are used.  They are adapted to the Mac's File Manager as follows:

 * The root directory "/" is not defined yet.
 * The home directory "~" is not defined yet.
 * A user directory "~user" is defined as a volume "user:".
 * The current directory "." works normally.
 * The parent directory ".." works normally.

Mac filenames are mangled as follows:

 * A filename consisting entirely of dots '.' gets two more dots prepended.
 * A slash '/' appears as ":2f".
 * A tilde '~' is not mangled.  If you have a directory "~user", use "./~user".

Commands
========

So far, there is no general support for options, only that implemented by individual commands.  File globbing is not implemented at all yet.

aevt
	Sends an Apple event to another process, possibly on another machine.
cd
	Changes directory.  (Built-in)
cp
	Copies and renames a file, or copies multiple files into a directory.
echo
	Echoes its arguments.  (Built-in)
ls
	Lists the files in a directory.
mkdir
	Creates new directories.
mv
	Moves or renames a file, or moves multiple files into a directory.
pwd
	Prints the working directory.
rm
	Not implemented.
rmdir
	Not implemented.
shutdown
	Shuts down or reboots the system.
touch
	Updates the modified date of a file, creating the file if it doesn't exist.

Bugs
****

Pathname conversion
===================

 * "./~user" doesn't work -- it's the same as "~user".
 * Slash '/' unmangling often doesn't happen.
 * pwd output is informative, but invalid.

Commands
========

 * Few options.

Shell
=====

 * No file globbing.
 * No I/O redirection.
 * No variable substitution (or variables).
 * No command substitution.
 * No command history.

Console
=======

 * No global copy and paste.
