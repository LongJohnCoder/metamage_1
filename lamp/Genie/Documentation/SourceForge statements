Purpose
-------

The project (LAMP) is an ambitious effort to bring POSIX features to Mac OS.

LAMP's scope includes protocols and libraries that implement pipes between Mac applications, an application that provides command shell windows, ports of the GNU toolchain, and anything else that makes it easier to port unix tools.

'LAMP' stands for "LAMP Ain't Mac POSIX".  The name also fits nicely with the command shell server, named 'Genie'.

Description
-----------

LAMP is an ambitious effort to bring POSIX features to Mac OS.  The main thrust is currently a command shell server named Genie, which offers unix-work-alike shell windows (think xterms).
