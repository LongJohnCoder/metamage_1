INTRODUCTION

This is sfio, ported to the Apple Macintosh. This port has not yet been
tested extensively, except for the standard test programs. Several Unix
features (sfpopen()) have been removed; the only feature that has been
added is the %#s format specifier for Pascal String I/O.

USING SFIO

To use this version of sfio, you need GUSI 2.0. If you're using sfio in 
combination with the MPW shell, please run Sfio_Install.MPW, which will 
cause the SFIO shell variable to be set to the sfio installation at
startup. 

The sfio include directory needs to be specified in your access paths *before* 
the standard C compiler includes. This will allow you to use sfio's stdio 
emulation. There is no way yet to use sfio with C++ IOstreams.
