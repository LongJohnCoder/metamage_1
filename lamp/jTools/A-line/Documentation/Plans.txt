A-line Development Overview
===========================

Current State
-------------

A-line was originally conceived as an alternative to the CodeWarrior IDE on Mac OS 9.  At present, it supports various options for Mac OS development:  68K and PowerPC architectures, segments, CFM/PEF, and Mach-O runtimes, and classic and Carbon API's.  CodeWarrior and gcc are the currently supported toolkits, and the native MPW compilers (SC and MrC) are also possible candidates.  A-line does not support CodeWarrior's native OS X tools (CW Pro 8 and later) and consequently can't target Mach-O with CodeWarrior.  A-line has been extensively used with CW Pro 6.

Current Targets
---------------

* 68K code resources (including segments)
* CFM-68K
* PowerPC, classic Toolbox (opaque UPP's required for Nitrogen)
* PPC Carbon CFM
* PPC Carbon/POSIX Mach-O (gcc only)

Completed Tasks
---------------

Catalog transition:  The alias-based project catalog that broke under OS X has been replaced.  The new scheme recursively walks the filesystem starting from a Projects folder, pruning the search at any folder containing the file A-line.conf or directory A-line.confd.  Config files can specify further subdirectories to be searched (which were otherwise pruned).

Mach-O and gcc:  A-line is self-hosting in Mach-O.  It also cross-compiles with CodeWarrior using a Mach-O tlsrvr.

Application bundles are created for Mach-O apps.

Current Plans
-------------

The project config file format is overdue for documentation and revision.  Current issues include deduction of defaults and project-specific customization (e.g. defining macros).  The dependency system needs to be expanded; in addition to the dependent operations including and linking, we also need to set CFM init and term procs based on our prerequisites -- we can't just use the multiplexor unconditionally, because this creates dependencies that may be superfluous, e.g. for /bin/true.

The search for specified source files should not be recursive; this creates too much trouble with code trees like perl's where the source files are at top level (ruling out the 'search' directive) and a large number of files and directories are also present.

A-line sorely needs debug logging, so you can tell what it's thinking.

Subsequent milestones:

* application bundle support
* Mach-O runtime support

Future Plans
------------

Other improvements under consideration for A-line:

* MPW compilers (SC and MrC)
* OS X dylibs
* OS X frameworks
* Linux port
