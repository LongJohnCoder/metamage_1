A-line Development Overview
===========================

by Joshua Juran, 2004-04-06

Current State
-------------

A-line was originally conceived as an alternative to the CodeWarrior IDE on Mac OS 9.  At present, it supports various options for Mac OS development:  68K/PowerPC architecture, segments/CFM runtime, and classic/Carbon API.  CodeWarrior is the only toolkit supported currently, but A-line was always intended to be usable with different toolsets (and the native MPW compilers were supported in the past).

Current Plans
-------------

A-line is undergoing a transition to Mac OS X.  The first step is to replace the catalog system, since the alias-based strategy that worked for OS 9 fails with OS X.

Subsequent milestones:

* self-hosting in native OS X
* application bundle support
* Mach-O runtime support

Future Plans
------------

Other improvements under consideration for A-line:

* gcc support
* OS X dylibs
* OS X frameworks
* Linux port
